# C++ Snake game using GUI

For my semester 1 final programming project, I chose to delve into the timeless realm of game development by crafting a classic Snake game using C++. Drawing inspiration from the provided source file, I embarked on a journey to expand upon its foundation, aiming to create a polished and immersive gaming experience while honing my programming skills.


**Project Vision:**

The Snake game, a staple of arcade gaming, offers a simple yet captivating gameplay concept: navigate a snake across a grid, consuming fruits to grow longer while avoiding collisions with obstacles. My project aimed to encapsulate the essence of this beloved game, infusing it with modern enhancements and features to elevate the gaming experience.


**Enhancements and Challenges:**

Building upon the provided source file presented a myriad of challenges and opportunities for growth:

1. **Graphics Overhaul:** The provided source file utilized the graphics.h library for visual rendering, but its compatibility limitations prompted the exploration of alternative graphic rendering solutions. I experimented with modern graphics libraries and frameworks such as SFML or SDL to achieve vibrant visuals and smooth animations compatible with contemporary compilers and platforms.

2. **User Interaction Refinement:** Crafting responsive and intuitive user input handling was paramount for creating an immersive gaming experience. I refined the input system to seamlessly capture player actions, allowing for precise control over the snake's movement and enhancing overall gameplay fluidity.

3. **Collision Detection Optimization:** While the provided source file included basic collision detection logic, further optimization was necessary to ensure accuracy and reliability. I delved into advanced collision detection algorithms, refining them to detect collisions between the snake's head and its body segments, as well as with game boundaries, thereby enhancing gameplay realism and challenge.

4. **Gameplay Expansion:** Beyond the core gameplay mechanics, I sought to enrich the gaming experience with additional features and content. This included implementing score tracking, level progression, power-ups, and customizable game settings, offering players a more dynamic and immersive journey through the Snake universe.


**Conclusion:**

The development of the classic Snake game for my semester 1 final programming project was a transformative endeavor that encapsulated both the challenges and joys of game development. Through overcoming technical hurdles and refining gameplay mechanics, I honed my programming skills, gained invaluable insights into software engineering principles, and deepened my passion for game development. The project stands as a testament to my growth as a programmer and serves as a springboard for future explorations in the exciting world of game development.
